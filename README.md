This project is part of a Challenge assignment. The purpose was to create a web application from scratch. Our goal is to buil d aportfolio page, to which we can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio is meant to showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill positions by highlighting our strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 


## Usage

This application is meant to present a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that an employer can review samples of their work and assess whether they are a good candidate.
